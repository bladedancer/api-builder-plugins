# api-builder-plugin-gm-fswatch

A bit of a contrived example, a node that allows you to set up watches on the file system and triggers a flow when the file system change event fires.

## Install

After creating your API Builder service, you can install this plugin using npm:

```
npm install --save @bladedancer/api-builder-plugin-gm-fswatch
```
